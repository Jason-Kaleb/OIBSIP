* This repository will contain the Java projects that i will be doing during my one-month internship at OasisInfoByte..

# Task number 1: Online Reservation System

* 🔗Login form --> The form allows the end user to access the online reservation system with the use of a Username and Password. After providing the correct Username and Password, users will able to access the main system as shown in the video. All this is done with a database created in mySQL xampp.

* 🔗Reservation screen --> This is the main screen for the end users after successfully logging in. It allows the users to fill in their first and last names, train number but when the train number is entered the train name will automatically appears in the text field, class type, date of journey, from (place) to destination. After filling the information users can book to secure a seat and a PNR is allocated upon booking.

* 🔗Cancel Booking --> If passengers want to cancel their bookings then they have to provide their PNR number and after submitting it, this will display the entire information related to that particular PNR number. If users want to confirm their cancellation, in this case, they have to press the OK button.

# Task number 2: Guessing Game

* ->The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 (configurable). 🔥 

* -> Users try to guess the hidden number by entering their input in a designated text field. ⌨️

* -> After each guess, the game provides feedback:
  -If the guess is correct, the user wins and the hidden number is revealed!
  -If the guess is too low, the user receives a hint to guess higher😆 .
  -If the guess is too high, the user receives a hint to guess lower.

* -> To add a bit of challenge, the user has a limited number of attempts (customizable). This keeps the gameplay engaging and encourages strategic guessing. 👾
